# DeepLearningND
These are the five projects I did for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree (links to webpage displaying the jupyter notebooks).
- [Predict bike share users](https://wantan244.github.io/Predict-bike-share-users/) (Neural Network)
- [Dog Breed Classifier](https://wantan244.github.io/Dog-Breed-Classifier/) (Convolutional Neural Network)
- [Generate TV Scripts](https://wantan244.github.io/Generate-TV-Scripts/) (Recurrent Neural Network)
- [Generate faces](https://wantan244.github.io/Generate-faces/) (Generative Adversarial Network)
- [Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly](https://wantan244.github.io/Teach-a-Quadcopter/) (Reinforcement Learning).
