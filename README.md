# DeepLearningND
These are the five projects I did for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
- Predict bike share users(Neural Network)
- Dog Breed Classifier (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Generate TV Scripts (Recurrent Neural Network)
- Generate faces (Generative Adversarial Network)
- Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly (Reinforcement Learning).
